### Getting a Penn Key
_skip if you are already a student at Penn or already have a Penn key_

* Once your background verification passes, you will get an avalanche of emails. Most of it involves hiring paperwork and another for creating your Penn key. 
* After creating your penn key youâ€™ll want to go [here](https://computing.sas.upenn.edu/help/students/email/options) to create an email address. Unfortunately, staff only get an outlook email. But you can set up a forwarding email address. After submitting your request to create an email, it should take a couple of days to process.
