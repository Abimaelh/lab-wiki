# Background checks

Here’s the three clearances anyone working with kids needs, and some extra notes on them:

**For each of these, BE SURE TO PRINT A PDF OF THE PAYMENT PAGE BEFORE CLICKING SUBMIT. Some of the sites will give you a receipt, but others will not display one after payment! Once you have each receipt, you need to forward them to** [**adminstaff@psych.upenn.edu**](mailto:adminstaff@psych.upenn.edu) **with a description of what they are, and what the funding source is (account number). CC John on the email so he can verify that he approves the charges.**

In compliance with Pennsylvania law (Act 153 of 2014, as amended by Act 15 of 2015) requiring employers to complete background checks on those who have “direct contact” with minors (including students, postdocs, trainees, and volunteers),  you have been identified as someone who will have “direct contact” or “routine interaction” with minors. In compliance with the law, you will have to complete the **three part background checks** required by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania:

1\)      **FBI criminal background check** verified by a fingerprint check through [IdentoGO](https://uenroll.identogo.com) (instructions for this are attached to this email).

_This is the one we’ve had the most problems with, so definitely make sure to follow up if you don’t get it in a timely manner — you will need to call the FBI and request that they send another copy._

1. &#x20;     **You can request an authorization code which applies a full discount for the background check.**
2. &#x20;    Once you receive the results of the FBI fingerprint check you will need to email a copy of the results to **Kirwin@sas.upenn.edu** or mail a copy to **3600 Market, Suite 501, Philadelphia, PA 19104, Attn. SAS HR.**

**-(Might be outdated, but here for reference)**This check can be waived for **volunteers** (not for anyone receiving payment) if they have been PA residents for the past ten years, **but** you’ll have to write up an affidavit that conforms to the PA legal code. Here’s an model:[ http://www.bpsd.org/Downloads/VOLUNTEER%20REQUEST%20FOR%20WAIVER%20OF8.pdf](http://www.bpsd.org/Downloads/VOLUNTEER%20REQUEST%20FOR%20WAIVER%20OF8.pdf)

2\)      **PA Criminal History Report (PATCH)** instruction will be communicated through the first email from our online vendor **TrueScreen.** &#x20;

&#x20;

**3)**      **PA Child Abuse History** also through TrueScreen. You must wait until you are **emailed the payment code** from Truescreen, _after_ you complete the PA Criminal History check**. This will be the SECOND EMAIL from TrueScreen.**

While completing the required background checks involves multiple steps, the clearances are valid for five years.  The results of the FBI fingerprint check take longer to return than the other two checks so we recommend registering as soon as possible. We strongly recommend allowing at least **a month** before working or interacting with any minors.

The results of the PA Criminal Check and Child Abuse History will be submitted directly to Penn through TrueScreen. You will receive instructions from our vendor TrueScreen to complete the PA Criminal History Report and PA Child Abuse History shortly. Both of these will be completed through a secure online portal only.
