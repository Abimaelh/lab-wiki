# Background checks

Here’s the three clearances anyone working with kids needs, and some extra notes on them:

In compliance with Pennsylvania law (Act 153 of 2014, as amended by Act 15 of 2015) requiring employers to complete background checks on those who have “direct contact” with minors (including students, postdocs, trainees, and volunteers),  you have been identified as someone who will have “direct contact” or “routine interaction” with minors. In compliance with the law, you will have to complete the **three part background checks** required by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania:

1\)      **FBI criminal background check** verified by a fingerprint check through [IdentoGO](https://uenroll.identogo.com) (HR will email you instructions).

_This is the one we’ve had the most problems with, so definitely make sure to follow up if you don’t get it in a timely manner — you will need to call the FBI and request that they send another copy._

1. **You can request an authorization code which applies a full discount for the background check.**
2. Once you receive the results of the FBI fingerprint check you will need to email a copy of the results to **humanresources@sas.upenn.edu**.

**This check can be waived for **volunteers**** (not for anyone receiving payment) if they have been PA residents for the past ten years, **but** you’ll have to write up an affidavit that conforms to the PA legal code. Email HR and ask whether you can sign an affidavit in lieu of the background checks.

2\) **PA Criminal History Report (PATCH)** instruction will be communicated through the first email.

3\) **PA Child Abuse History** also provided in the first batch of emails you receive from HR. 

While completing the required background checks involves multiple steps, the clearances are valid for five years.  The results of the FBI fingerprint check take longer to return than the other two checks so we recommend registering as soon as possible. We strongly recommend allowing at least **a month** before working or interacting with any minors.

The results of the PA Criminal Check and Child Abuse History will be submitted directly to Penn through a third party company. You will receive instructions from that company to complete the PA Criminal History Report and PA Child Abuse History shortly. Both of these will be completed through a secure online portal.
