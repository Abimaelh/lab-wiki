## Running online experiments

We use PCIbex to create online experiments. If you're new to Ibex, we recommend you complete [this tutorial](https://doc.pcibex.net/basic-tutorial/).

To include multimedia resources in your experiment view this [guide](https://doc.pcibex.net/how-to-guides/managing-resources/).
* We use [dreamhost](https://www.dreamhost.com/wordpress/woocommerce-hosting/?gclid=CjwKCAjwsJ6TBhAIEiwAfl4TWF6Crd3Z2LW8N6cwguMU7OrJlJgYvqABd2vCAHhZkzxY5enjrtkmdBoCoK0QAvD_BwE) to host our media. Contact the lab manager for account information. 
    * To add media to dreamhost you can use the web ftp by simply logging in or connect via a client, like [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/). 
    * More information on FTP and dreamhost can be found [here](https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027-FTP-overview-and-credentials).


After you are added to our lab bucket (To be added to our lab bucket see [onboarding](onboarding.md)) You can download your data
