## Facebook
Facebook Ads Manager is a unified ad creation tool that you can use to create and publish ads to Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and Audience Network.

> The ad creation workflow is made up of three distinct levels: 
* Campaign level: This is where you select the ad objective, or overall goal of your campaign.
* Ad set level: This is where you define the audience you’d like to reach, choose your ad placements, determine a budget and set a schedule.
* Ad level: This is where you’ll design the ads themselves. You can choose your ad format, upload images and video, and add text, links and more.

> To create ads in Ads Manager:
* Create your campaign: From the main table in Ads Manager, select Create to open the Create a Campaign window. In this window, you’ll select the basic settings for your new campaign, ad set and ad. You can also use existing campaigns, ad sets or ads to create new ones.
* Refine your settings: Select Continue to move on to the editing pane. This pane will open in an expanded view, but you can select  to minimize it. In the editing pane you’ll choose a campaign objective, audience, placement and ad format.
* Publish or save as draft: When you’re ready, select Publish or Close to save your draft.
