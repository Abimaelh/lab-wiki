# Onboarding procedures

## Getting a Penn Key
_skip if you are already a student at Penn or already have a Penn key_

* Once HR verifies your background check, you will get an avalanche of emails. Most of it involves hiring paperwork and instructions on creating your Penn Key. 
* After creating your Penn Key you’ll want to go [here](https://computing.sas.upenn.edu/help/students/email/options) to create an email address. Unfortunately, staff only get an outlook email. But you can set up a forwarding email address. After submitting your request to create an email, it should take a couple of days to process. 
    * Once you have your Penn Key you can begin completing background checks for working with minors in the lab. See [background checks](background-checks.md).
* You have to be added to our IRB protocol in order to work with minors, collect and analyze data. First, Complete CITI training and send your certificates to the lab manager.
    * Steps:

## Joining our internal systems

* Our primary method of communication is Slack. Email the lab manager or John to invite you to the lab slack channel.
* We store most of data and stimuli on Penn Box, a cloud-based content management and file sharing tool. You will also need to be invited to this service.
    *   **DO NOT SYNC YOUR COMPUTER WITH PENN BOX**
* We send out weekly reminders of lab events and meetings to our lab mailing list. Email the lab manager to add you to the mailing list. 

## CITI Training
* If you are working in the lab (creating, running, processing, or analyzing data), you must complete CITI Training. This training ensures that you understand the ethical implications of doing human subjects research.
* If you've worked in a research lab before, you may have completed this training already. If not, you should complete [this training](https://about.citiprogram.org/en/homepage/) as soon as possible. 
    * Create an account and make sure to add Penn as your institution. Scroll to the bottom of the "My Courses" page and click "Add a course."
    * When you click on add courses, select "Protection of Human Subjects" for the first question. Question 2 should be "No." You skip to Question 4 and select Group 2: Social/Behavioral Research Course. For question 6, answer "No." Question 7 is also "No." After completing these steps, you can take the Social/Behavioral Research Course. After you are done with the training modules, please send me the completion report and certificate.

## Setup an Active Directory account
* Have you set up an active directory? Your AD account is the same account that you use to access your SAS server share. It is also what is used to log in when using on-campus computers.
    * [Request form](https://computing.sas.upenn.edu/help/faculty_staff/forms/ad_request)
    * Account Request Reason(s):
        * I require a home directory ("U: drive) to store my documents and/or for data backup
        * I require access to a shared folder/resource in my department/workgroup
        * I am a new employee and require the account to get started in my position.
 
 ## Sign-up for a VPN account
 * The VPN is used to access lab computers remotely. We use FortiClient. In order to use FortiClient, you need to create a KITE account.    
    * [Request form](https://computing.sas.upenn.edu/faculty_staff/VPN)
    * Download FortiClient. The VPN name should be: SAS VPN Neptune2, and then try logging in using your KITE info. You will have to confirm your identity via duo-mobile. All you have to do for now is try to connect to the VPN. 

## Keys
* You can request a key if you would like access to the lab and shared space. It requires a $15 deposit (unfortunately), which you’ll get back when you return the key. You can email our department manager Yuni Thornton at yc@sas.upenn.edu to request a key.

## RedCap
* RedCap is a secure web application that can be used to build and manage surveys and databases online. We use it to consent subjects.
    * [Request form](https://redcap.med.upenn.edu/surveys/?s=YbCvd4)
    * Only answer the questions that are required and leave the rest blank. For supervisor/PI write down John's name. For notes, write down that your PI requested that you create an account.

## Setup a PCIbex account
* Jérémy Zehr manages PCIbex and we use it to create online experiments. All data gets stored on our Amazon Web Services (AWS) server which you can access once you have been added to our lab "bucket." 
    * [Request form](https://forms.gle/1T6a7s9x8sPYrUJt7) 
    * For account type click on "Penn PCIbex Farm user account AND AWS Account for direct access to lab/research group-storage bucket."

## Website bio
* Lastly, Send the lab manager a short blurb and picture of yourself if you want to be added to our lab website. You can view some examples [here](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/trueswell-lab/people/)
